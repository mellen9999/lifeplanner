# lifeplanner

a local, private life dashboard — **calendar · appointments · achievements · todos** — with a
twist: an llm can read and write it too. one set of plain json files on your disk, two doors into
them: a fast vanilla web ui for you, and an [mcp](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for an
assistant like claude. no accounts, no cloud, no tracking. your data never leaves your machine.

- **stdlib-only web app** — python 3.8+, no dependencies. clone and run.
- **square, terminal-styled ui** — light + dark, eight accent colors, keyboard-first (vim keys).
- **read-only `.ics` feed** — subscribe from your phone, see appointments + due todos there.
- **mcp server** — let an assistant log your wins, add todos, and review your day (one optional dep).
- **bulletproof storage** — atomic writes, cross-process lock, corrupt-file-safe. tested.

## quick start

```sh
git clone <repo> lifeplanner && cd lifeplanner
./launch.sh            # or: python3 app.pyw
```

opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. bound to localhost only — nothing is exposed to your network.
launching again just focuses the running window (only one server runs at a time).

no build step, no `npm`, no dependencies for the app itself.

## how to use it

five sections (number keys switch them):

1. **today** — your daily glance. appointments today, todos due/overdue, today's wins with a
   one-field win logger, the next 7 days, and a streak ribbon. open this first each day.
2. **calendar** — month grid; click a day to see/add what's on it. colored marks: green = a win,
   blue = an appointment, yellow = a due todo.
3. **appointments** — things at a time. add with a date (+ optional time) and place. set
   **repeat** (daily / weekly / every-other-week / monthly) to make it recur — the list shows the
   next occurrence, the calendar marks every one, and your phone gets it as a standard repeating event.
4. **achievements** — your wins log, with a contribution heatmap + streak counters. log small wins
   often; watching the streak grow is the point.
5. **todos** — things to do; give one a due date and it becomes a reminder on the calendar + phone.

every item can be edited in place (`e` or double-click) or deleted (`×` / `d d`). nothing needs
saving — it's written to disk the moment you add it.

## keys

| keys | action | | keys | action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `1` … `5` | switch section | | `h` / `l` | prev / next month |
| `n` | new item | | `e` / dbl-click | edit selected |
| `j` / `k` | move selection | | `enter` | save edit / open day |
| `x` | toggle todo done | | `t` | toggle light / dark |
| `d` `d` | delete selected | | `r` · `?` | refresh · help |

theme and accent are saved with your data.

## let an assistant in (optional mcp)

```sh
./install.sh           # linux/mac — or install.bat on windows
```

it creates `.venv`, installs the mcp sdk, and prints a ready `claude mcp add …` line (the windows
script prints the `\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` path). run it, restart claude, and check `/mcp`. the assistant
then has these tools, all writing to the same local files the web app reads:

read: `get_overview` · `get_day` · `get_week` · `list_achievements` · `list_todos` ·
`list_appointments`
write: `add_achievement` · `add_todo` · `complete_todo` · `add_appointment` ·
`update_achievement` · `update_todo` · `update_appointment` · `delete_item`

writes from the assistant appear in your open ui within a few seconds; your edits are visible to it
immediately. (works with any mcp client — claude desktop, claude code, etc.)

## phone calendar (one-way, read-only)

appointments and due-dated todos are written to `data/lifeplanner.ics` on every change. to see them
on your phone:

1. sync the file to your phone (e.g. [syncthing](https://syncthing.net)), or set `ics_sync_path`
   in `data/settings.json` to a synced folder.
2. install a calendar-subscription app — [ICSx5](https://icsx5.bitfire.at) (foss) on android.
3. subscribe to the synced `lifeplanner.ics`. it refreshes on a schedule.

read-only by design: you edit in the app, the phone just shows it. no always-on server, no network
exposure, survives reboots.

## configuration

all optional, via environment variables:

| var | default | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LIFEPLANNER_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | bind address (keep localhost unless you know why) |
| `LIFEPLANNER_PORT` | `8765` | http port |
| `LIFEPLANNER_DATA` | `./data` | where your json + `.ics` live (point at a synced/XDG dir) |

## layout

```
app.pyw          web server + rest api (stdlib only)
store.py         shared data layer — atomic writes, file lock, .ics generation
mcp_server.py    mcp server (assistant's door; needs the mcp sdk)
web/             ui — vanilla html / css / js
tests/           data-layer test suite (python3 -m unittest discover -s tests)
launch.sh        linux/mac launcher        launch.bat   windows launcher
install.sh       optional mcp setup        install.bat  windows mcp setup
data/            your data (created on first run, gitignored — never committed)
```

## data + safety

plain json in `data/`. back it up by copying the folder. files fail safe to empty rather than
crashing, writes are atomic (temp + rename), and the ui and assistant are serialized by a lockfile
so concurrent writes can't corrupt anything. your data dir is gitignored — it will never end up in a
commit.

## tests

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
